# EncoderPlus

EncoderPlus counts pulses from quadrature encoded signals, which are
commonly available from rotary knobs, motor or shaft sensors and other
position sensors.

It is a slight modification of PJRC's Encoder library that adds
callbacks to the encoder signal interrupts. This hurts performance,
but allows conversion of signals into step and direction pulses, etc.
